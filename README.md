### Overview

`shiny.reviewer` is an R package providing a configurable [shiny
app](https://shiny.posit.co/) allowing users submit and interactively
filter and view content reviews. The app is designed to be accessed by
multiple simultaneous users, on mobile devices, with a synchronized
experience.

The package also includes helper methods to configure authentication for
Google Sheets, which enables persistent storage when deploying to
platforms like [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io) or [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A demo is available here:
[shiny-reviewer-demo](https://lanceupton.shinyapps.io/shiny-reviewer-demo)

### Usage

To install this package, execute the following:

``` r
remotes::install_github("lanceupton/shiny.reviewer")
```

To run a simple example, execute the following:

``` r
library(shiny.reviewer)
app_run(
  title = "Your Application Title",
  content_meta = CONTENT_META_EXAMPLE,
  reviews = REVIEWS_EXAMPLE, 
  group_meta = GROUP_META_EXAMPLE,
  launch.browser = TRUE
)
```

This runs an application using the provided example content (Mario Kart
Wii tracks). This will work fine, but youâ€™ll probably want to define
your own content and record reviews submitted by users. The below
boilerplate code leverages the provided methods to sync reviews to a
Google Sheets file. It assumes that you have called `DEV_auth_set()` to
write an encrypted gs4 token to the project directory.

``` r
library(shiny.reviewer)
library(gargle)
library(googlesheets4)
DEV_auth_get()
# Define Google sheets file ID and sheet here
REVIEWS_SSID <- Sys.getenv("REVIEWS_SSID")
REVIEWS_SHEET <- Sys.getenv("REVIEWS_SHEET")
# Read the Google Sheets file
reviews <- read_sheet(ss = REVIEWS_SSID, sheet = REVIEWS_SHEET)
# Read custom metadata
content_meta <- read.csv("data-raw/CONTENT_META.csv")
group_meta <- read.csv("data-raw/GROUP_META.csv")
# Run application
app_run(
  title = "Your Application Title",
  content_meta = content_meta,
  reviews = reviews, 
  group_meta = group_meta,
  # Append session reviews to the Google Sheets file
  callback = function(df) {
    sheet_append(ss = REVIEWS_SSID, data = df, sheet = REVIEWS_SHEET)
  },
  launch.browser = TRUE
)
```

### Features

#### Explore Content

The main interface includes a button for each content item, styled based
on the most recent review.

**(TODO)** If `group_meta` is provided, content is grouped into cards.

#### Review Content

When a content button is clicked, a popup is displayed which allows you
to submit a content review.

### Thanks

- [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) - This makes it
  easy to implement persistent data storage in remote environments.

- [shinyMobile](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/) - This is so
  easy to use, and provides beautiful components.
