### Overview

`shiny.reviewer` is an R package providing a configurable [shiny app](https://shiny.posit.co/)
allowing users submit and interactively filter and view content reviews. The
app is designed to be accessed by multiple simultaneous users, on mobile
devices, with a synchronized experience.

The package also includes helper methods to configure authentication for Google
Sheets, which enables persistent storage when deploying to platforms like
[shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A demo is available here: [shiny-reviewer-demo](https://lanceupton.shinyapps.io/shiny-reviewer-demo)


### Usage

To install this package, execute the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("lanceupton/shiny.reviewer")
```

To run a simple example, execute the following:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny.reviewer)
app_run(
  title = "Your Application Title",
  content_meta = CONTENT_META_EXAMPLE,
  reviews = REVIEWS_EXAMPLE, 
  group_meta = GROUP_META_EXAMPLE,
  launch.browser = TRUE
)
```

This runs an application using the provided example content (Mario Kart Wii
tracks). This will work fine, but you'll probably want to record all the reviews
submitted by users. This is where `callback` comes in handy. The below
boilerplate code leverages the provided methods to sync reviews to a Google
Sheets file. It assumes that you have called `DEV_auth_set()` to write an
encrypted gs4 token to the project directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(shiny.reviewer)
library(gargle)
library(googlesheets4)
DEV_auth_get()
# Define Google sheets file ID and sheet here
REVIEWS_SSID <- Sys.getenv("REVIEWS_SSID")
REVIEWS_SHEET <- Sys.getenv("REVIEWS_SHEET")
# Read the Google Sheets file
reviews <- read_sheet(ss = REVIEWS_SSID, sheet = REVIEWS_SHEET)
# Read custom metadata
content_meta <- read.csv("data-raw/CONTENT_META.csv")
group_meta <- read.csv("data-raw/GROUP_META.csv")
# Run application
app_run(
  title = "Your Application Title",
  content_meta = content_meta,
  reviews = reviews, 
  group_meta = group_meta,
  # Append session reviews to the Google Sheets file
  callback = function(df) {
    sheet_append(ss = REVIEWS_SSID, data = df, sheet = REVIEWS_SHEET)
  },
  launch.browser = TRUE
)
```    


### Features

**View Content**

The main interface includes a button for each content item, styled based on the
most recent review.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(
  x = data.frame(
    c("Blacklisted (`blacklist=TRUE`)", "Top Rated (`rating=5`)", "Unreviewed (`timestamp=NA`)", "All Other Content"),
    c("![](readme_files/content_blacklisted.png)", "![](readme_files/content_5star.png)", "![](readme_files/content_unreviewed.png)", "![](readme_files/content_default.png)")
  ),
  col.names = c("Content Class", "Content Preview")
)
```

Additionally, all content buttons display the emojis included within the `notes`
field of the most recent review.

**Filter Content**

The left sidebar includes an interface to filter content items based on the most
recent review.

The right sidebar includes an interface to search for content by title.

**Review Content**

A content button may be clicked to submit a review.

* [googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/) - This makes it easy to
implement persistent data storage in remote environments.

* [shinyMobile](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/) - This is so easy to use, and provides beautiful
components.
